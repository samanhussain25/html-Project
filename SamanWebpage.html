		<h2>About Liberica</h2>
	<p>Liberica coffee is a species of coffee plant that was first discovered in Liberia which gives it its name.It’s a much larger plant/tree than other species, growing to 20m in height and producing coffee beans that are much larger than other varieties.

Liberica is the 3rd most popular coffee for drinking, accounting for 2% of the world’s consumption behind the behemoths of Arabica (about 75%) and Robusta (about 20%).

The coffee it makes is still coffee. It’s brown, it’s inherently bitter and it’s caffeinated, all the things you’ve come to expect from your favorite drink.

It has not entered the consciousness of coffee brewers and roasters in the West, presumably as a consequence of its difficulty to obtain and perhaps its unappealing taste.

Despite this, in certain countries it remains very popular, particularly for its use in cheaper ways of selling coffee such as instant coffee.</p>

		<h3>About Robusta</h3>
	<p>Behind Coffee Arabica, Robusta is the second-most popular coffee in the world today. It is produced by the Coffea canephoraplant, which was originally grown in the western and central portions of sub-Saharan Africa.

About 40% of the world’s coffee consumed each day is Coffee Robusta. When combined with Coffee Arabica, these two products represent between 95% to 99% of the beans purchased each year.

That’s an impressive feat, consider there are 100+ different coffee species which are currently growing in the world today.</p>

		<h4>About Arabica</h4>
	<p>Its origins date back to about 1,000 BC in the highlands of the Kingdom of Kefa, which is present-day Ethiopia. In Kefa, the Oromo tribe ate the bean, crushed it and mixed it with fat to make spheres the size of ping-pong balls. The spheres were consumed for the same reason that coffee is consumed today, as a stimulant.

The plant species Coffea Arabica got its name around the 7th century when the bean crossed the Red Sea from Ethiopia to present-day Yemen and lower Arabia, hence the term "arabica."

The first written record of coffee made from roasted coffee beans comes from Arab scholars, who wrote that it was useful in prolonging their working hours. The Arab innovation in Yemen of making a brew from roasted beans spread first among the Egyptians and Turks, and later on, found its way around the world.</p>
